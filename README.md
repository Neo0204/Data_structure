# Data_structure
I studied Data structure by C Language at KyungPook University in Fall 2019.

There are so many subjects such as stack,queue,tree,graph,sort and hash by C

Every Folder is independent and it's name is subject name.

Each folder consists of one header file(.h) and two code files(.c).

There is a header file(.h) which define and declare header guard, variant, function.
And one of the code file(f.c) write function module.
Another code file is that test file(test_blahblahblah.c) has main function.



If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me
