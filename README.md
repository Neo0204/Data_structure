# Data_structure
I studied Data structure by C Language at KyungPook University in Fall 2019.

There are so many subjects such as stack,queue,tree,graph,sort and hash by C

Every Folder name is independent it's subject name.



Each folder consists of one header file(.h) and two code files(.c).

There is a header file(main.h) which define and declare header guard, variant, function.

And one of the code file(test.c) write function module.

Another code file is that test file(main.c) has main function.



And I write each README for every subject to explain method, feature,  significiance and limits. 





If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me
