# Data_structure
I studied Data structure by C Language at KyungPook University in Fall 2019.

There are so many subjects such as stack,queue,tree,graph,sort and hash by C

Every Folder is independent and it's name is subject name.

There are header file(.h) and function file(functionName.c) test file(Test_blahblahblah.c)


Header have

* Polynomial_ADD
* STACK
* ...
